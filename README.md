# Loiter bot

Software for a ROS2-based robot that seeks and approaches the obstacle it sees, and then wanders around nearby (not too far from it, but not too close either).

## Objective

I used this project to experiment with design approaches for finite state machine (FSM) based robot software. The navigation algorithm is crude. (Improving the algorithm is an exercise for another day.)

## Design

I started with an FSM implemented with a switch statement, but ended up replacing that approach with a design based on the Gang of Four (GoF: the book "Design Patterns" by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides) State Pattern. I found the GoF State Pattern lended itself more nicely to unit testing. It provided (/demanded) a clear contract for each state handler, and made it easy to do most debugging in the IDE before testing in the simulator.

## The robot

The robot is simulated (I used gazebo). It provides lidar readings by publishing sensor_msgs::msg::LaserScan messages, and accepts motion control commands by listening for geometry_msgs::msg::Twist messages.

The gazebo world I used can be started by running:
./scripts/start.sh
